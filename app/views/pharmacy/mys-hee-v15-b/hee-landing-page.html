    <p class="nhsuk-body">Use this service to make claims for education and training contributions for Foundation
      Trainee Pharmacists (FTPs).</p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You will need to register each trainee you need to make payment claims for and confirm their
      individual details when you make a claim.</p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">For registering an FTP, you will need to tell us:</p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">
      <li>their name</li>
    </p>
    <p class="nhsuk-body">
      <li>their date of birth</li>
    </p>
    <p class="nhsuk-body">
      <li>their GPhC registration number</li>
    </p>
    <p class="nhsuk-body">
      <li>their training start date</li>
    </p>
    <p class="nhsuk-body">
      <li>their Designated Supervisor's name</li>
    </p>
    <p class="nhsuk-body">
      <li>their Designated Supervisor's GPhC registration number</li>
    </p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You should begin claiming for the training grant when an FTP begins their training with you.
      Payments are paid monthly in arrears in accordance with Part XIII of the Drug Tariff.</p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You should also use this service to let us know of any changes regarding the training at your
      site, for example if you cease to become a training site or if a trainee leaves your training programme.</p>

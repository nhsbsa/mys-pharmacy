    <!-- <h2>Context</h2> -->
    <p>Use this service to make claims for training grant contributions for Foundation Trainee Pharmacists (FTPs) 
      and education and training contributions for Pre-registration Trainee Pharmacy Technicians (PTPTs).</p>

    <p>You will need to confirm the details of each FTP or PTPT you are claiming for separately.</p>

    <p>You should begin claiming for the training grant or education and training contributions at the start 
      of the training period. That is the point at which an FTP or PTPT begins their training with you.</p>

    <p>Payments are made monthly in arrears in accordance with Part XIII of the Drug Tariff for the FTP 
      training grant, and in accordance with a signed NHS England contract for the PTPT education and 
      training contributions.</p>

    <p>For each FTP, you will need to tell us their:</p>
    <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
      <li>name</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
      <li>GPhC registration number</li>
      <li>training start date</li>
      <li>Designated Supervisor’s name</li>
      <li>Designated Supervisor’s GPhC registration number</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For each PTPT, you will need to tell us their:</p>
    <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
      <li>name</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
      <li>training start date</li>
      <li>Designated Supervisor’s name</li>
      <li>Designated Supervisor’s GPhC registration number</li>
      <!--li>Educational Supervisor’s name</li>
      <li>Educational Supervisor’s GPhC registration number</li-->
    </ul>

    <p>You must inform the NHSBSA if the training situation changes, for example if you cease to become a 
      training site or if the trainee leaves your training programme.</p>

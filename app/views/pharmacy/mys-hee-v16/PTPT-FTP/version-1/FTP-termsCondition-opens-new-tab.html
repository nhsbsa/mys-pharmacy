        <li style="margin-left:80px;"><strong>4.26.2</strong> warrants that at all times it has and will have no reason to believe that any member of Staff is barred in accordance with the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006; and </li>
        <li style="margin-left:80px;"><strong>4.26.3</strong> shall ensure that no person is employed or otherwise engaged in the provision of the Services if that person is barred from carrying out, or whose previous conduct or records indicate that they would not be suitable to carry out, any regulated activities as defined by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 or may present a risk to Learners or any other person.</li>

    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.28</strong> The Provider shall immediately provide to NHS England any information that NHS England reasonably requests to enable NHS England to satisfy itself that the obligations set out in this clause 4 have been met.</li>

    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.30</strong> The relationship of the Provider to NHS England will be that of independent contractor and nothing in this contract shall render the Provider (or any of its Staff) an employee, worker, agent, partner or member of NHS England and the Provider shall not hold itself out as such.  This contract constitutes a contract for the provision of services and not a contract of employment and accordingly the Provider shall be fully responsible for and shall indemnify NHS England for and in respect of: </li>
        <li style="margin-left:80px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.30.1</strong> any income tax, national insurance and social security contributions and any other liability, deduction, contribution, assessment or claim arising from or made in connection with the performance of the Services.

    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.34</strong> Throughout the Term, the Provider will ensure its Business Continuity Plan provides for continuity during a Business Continuity Event.

        <li style="margin-left:80px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.34.2 </strong> the size and scope of the Provider’s business operations,</li>
    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"> regarding continuity of the provision of the Services during and following a Business Continuity Event.</li>  
    
    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.35</strong> The Provider shall test its Business Continuity Plan at reasonable intervals, and in any event no less than once every twelve (12) months or such other period as may be agreed between the Parties taking into account the criticality of this contract to NHS England and the size and scope of the Provider’s business operations. The Provider shall promptly provide to NHS England, at NHS England’s written request and within ten (10) Business Days, copies of its Business Continuity Plan, reasonable and proportionate documentary evidence that the Provider tests its Business Continuity Plan in accordance with the requirements of this contract and reasonable and proportionate information regarding the outcome of such tests. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.36</strong> The Provider shall provide to NHS England a copy of any updated or revised Business Continuity Plan within ten (10) Business Days of any material update or revision to the Business Continuity Plan. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.37</strong> NHS England may suggest reasonable and proportionate amendments to the Provider regarding the Business Continuity Plan at any time. Where the Provider, acting reasonably, deems such suggestions made by NHS England to be relevant and appropriate, the Provider will incorporate into the Business Continuity Plan all such suggestions made by NHS England in respect of such Business Continuity Plan.  Should the Provider not incorporate any suggestion made by NHS England into such Business Continuity Plan it will explain the reasons for not doing so to NHS England.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.38</strong> Should a Business Continuity Event occur at any time, the Provider shall implement and comply with its Business Continuity Plan and provide regular written reports to NHS England on such implementation.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:40px; padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>4.39</strong> During and following a Business Continuity Event, the Provider shall use reasonable endeavours to continue to provide the Services in accordance with this contract.</li>

        (1.4.1) The GPhC 2017 IET standards for pharmacy technicians require PTPTs to have the opportunity to work with the wider multi professional team to reflect the necessary knowledge and skills required of the role. We recognise that on occasion, supervision may be best placed with registered professionals outside of the pharmacy profession.  
        
        (1.4.1) The practice/clinical supervisor should meet with the PTPT at the start of a placement/rotation to agree learning outcomes, training and support.

        (1.4.1) Where a PTPT does not have placements / rotations, the practice / clinical supervisor should meet with the PTPT at the beginning of a 12-week period to agree learning outcomes, training and support. Following this, supervisors and PTPTs should meet mid-12-week period to provide interim feedback and support and then again at the end of the 12-week period to give summative feedback.</p>

<p> Where the Pharmacy Contractor wishes to operate a site that is not at their
  pharmacy and there is a Population Need identified, the Commissioner will select
  the sites that best meet that Population Need on the basis of the answers to the
  below questions (e.g. in instances where there are more proposals to operate sites
  away from pharmacy premises than would be required to meet the defined
  Population Need).</p>
  
  <p>The Commissioner will determine which proposal best meets Population Need
  using the information provided within the expressions of interest process, and so
  the Pharmacy Contractor should ensure that it answers all of the questions fully and
  comprehensively.</p>
  
  <p>Pharmacy Contractors may wish to review the eligible cohorts from previous
  campaigns (available in the Green Book) and local demographic data to better
  understand the Population Need in the past in order to inform their responses to the
  below questions. </p>

    from where vaccines would be administered.</h3>
<p> There will be flexibility to also
  vaccinate elsewhere with the prior consent of the Commissioner (for example a
  pop-up site). Vaccinations must only be offered where suitable facilities are
  available and patient dignity and confidentiality can be respected.  </p>

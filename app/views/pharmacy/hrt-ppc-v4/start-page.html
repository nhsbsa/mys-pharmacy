        <p>You can help your customer save money on NHS HRT prescriptions by selling them an HRT PPC.</p>
        
        <p>Each prescription item usually costs £9.65, but prepaying for an unlimited number of HRT prescription medications costs £19.30 for 12 months, the usual cost of 2 medications.</p>
        
        <p>After payment, we can send the certificate details to your customer by email or post. You can also give them the details to use yourself.</p>

        <p>Your customer needs to show their certificate details when they collect their HRT prescription. They can use it straight away if they start it from today.</p>
